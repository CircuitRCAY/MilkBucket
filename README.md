# MilkBucket
A Minecraft Java edition server re-implementation, written in Kotlin. The image is a placeholder until the real logo is here.

### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
Well, not exactly frequently, but you get the idea.

### Why does this exist?
Most of the main server implementations aren't very "performant", and tend to suffer on lower-end servers. This project exists to overcome the limitations made for Minecraft servers, and to bring a new alternative.

### What versions does this support?
Right now, this server is built for Minecraft **1.15.2**. Other versions will be supported, although slowly as this is a one-man project.

### How do I use it?
Right now, you don't. It's literally unplayable.

## Roadmap
- [x] Status (ping, server description)
- [ ] Maps and chunks
- [ ] Literally everything other than identifying the server.
